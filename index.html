<p style="font-family:Courier New">
This game was created using a modded version of a programing language called scratch. Scatch is a relatively simple block-coding language. <br>
  I created this game based on the book <i><a href="https://www.btboces.org/Downloads/7_There%20Will%20Come%20Soft%20Rains%20by%20Ray%20Bradbury.pdf">There will come soft rains</a></i> by <i><a href="https://raybradbury.com/">Ray Bradbury</a></i>. <br>
  The core gameplay is based on keeping the house clean. This is based on the fact that the book repetitively talked about how the house kept itself clean <br>
  The game also has fire, another aspect of the story.<br>
  The end goal of the game was to inclue stuff like the breakfast that you would have to clean up, but I didn't have enough time.<br>
  With more time I would have also added a final boss where a bunch of fire would spawn. <br>
